This is a Dynamic Custom Email Sender platform.
Send Emails to multiple users at once. You can also try templates and send all at once.

Built using HTML,CSS,BOOTSTRAP,JS and Django framework.
The project was to make a email sender where you can send emails to multiple users at once.
This multiple email sender also has pre-written mails or template mails, you can select and send multiple templates all together to different emails.

The biggest motivation to build this project was to push my own limits. It took me three days to build this project.
While building this project I learnt to implement so many things.

Thanks to my mentor sandesh jain for mentoring me throughout this project.
